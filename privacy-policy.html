	Pontoon Solutions, Inc. (&ldquo;Pontoon&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) respects the privacy of personal information we receive in the course of our business. This policy expresses Pontoon&#39;s commitment to maintain the privacy of personal information that is shared with us, outlines what types of personally identifiable information Pontoon receives, and summarizes what we do with this personal information.</p>
<h5>
	US-European Union and US-Switzerland Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</h5>
<p>
	Pontoon adheres to the US-European Union and US-Switzerland Safe Harbor frameworks in regards to the collection and processing of personal information gathered from the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;) and Switzerland. Pontoon has certified our adherence to the Safe Harbor principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement to the Department of Commerce. Personal information is any information that relates to an individual and that identifies or can be used to identify the individual. Pontoon&rsquo;s Safe Harbor certification will be available shortly. In the event any term or condition of this Privacy Policy conflicts with any of the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will control.</p>
<p>
	We monitor our Safe Harbor compliance internally and periodically conduct audits to verify compliance with both this Policy and the Safe Harbor Principles and we have agreed to comply with the relevant Data Protection Authorities in regard to the processing and collection of personal information. In the event you have questions or concerns regarding our use of personal information, we encourage you to contact the person listed below. Upon receipt of your notification, your questions or complaints will be internally investigated. Pontoon will comply with the applicable Data Protection Authorities in the handling of any unresolved complaints.</p>
<h5>
	Sources of Personal Information</h5>
<p>
	Pontoon is a provider of workforce solutions, which include the processing of recruitment, human resources, contingent worker, and contractor information for customers and their suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services. Pontoon has our own dedicated staff of employees and maintains personal information on our internal candidates, employees and contractors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Customer Information: Pontoon receives personal information of the current and former candidates, employees, contractors, and contingent workers of or on behalf of our customers for processing on behalf of each such customer.</li>
	<li>
		Supplier Information: Pontoon receives personal information of the current and former candidates, employees, contractors, and contingent workers of or on behalf of suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services who contract with us for processing such information on behalf of each such supplier and its customers.</li>
	<li>
		Internal Information: Pontoon receives personal information of its own internal current and former candidates, employees, contractors, and contingent workers. Pontoon also collects personal information voluntarily shared by persons through email correspondence or responses to inquiries on our website.</li>
</ul>
<h5>
	Uses of Personal Information</h5>
<p>
	Pontoon uses personal information supplied for legitimate business purposes, and to perform information processing services for which we have been contracted by our customers and their suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services. Pontoon uses personal information for such purposes as collecting and sorting resumes for position fulfillment, scheduling of interviews, payroll and benefits processing, evaluation and assessment, recordkeeping, invoicing and payment for our customers, their suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services, and for ourselves.</p>
<p>
	Pontoon shares personal information supplied by our customers and suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services, only for the purpose of the information processing services for which we were contracted. For example, Pontoon may share resumes and applicant information of candidates submitted by a recruiting firm as that firm directs for submission to a customer. Alternatively, Pontoon may share payroll information as applicable to the customer using staffing services and to the supplier of such services for billing and payroll purposes. Pontoon will otherwise maintain as confidential and not use or share personal information of individuals submitted by customers and suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services, with which we contract. Pontoon retains personal information of individuals submitted by customers and suppliers of recruiting, staffing, and consulting services with which we contract, so long as such controlling party directs.</p>
<p>
	Pontoon shares personal information received on our internal candidates, employees, contractors, and contingent workers, or from responses to inquiries on our website relating to Pontoon&#39;s internal business, only with our affiliated companies for legitimate business purposes, and we retain such personal information only for so long as necessary by law or for our legitimate business purpose. Pontoon also processes personal data for historical and statistical purposes but only in aggregated and summarized formats which eliminate reference to personal information.</p>
<p>
	Pontoon will share personal information as required by law or regulation, or in cooperation with law enforcement investigations, civil or criminal subpoenas, or when required by court orders. Pontoon will not sell personal information to mailing lists or share personal information to those who would use it for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
	In the event Pontoon shares any personal information collected from the EEA or from Switzerland with third parties (including clients and affiliated entities), Pontoon does, in accordance with Safe Harbor Principles, ensure those third parties are restricted from using the personal information in any way other than is consistent with the purposes for which it was collected, as described above. We do this by confirming all third parties receiving personal information collected from the EEA or from Switzerland are either: Safe Harbor certified; bound by European or Swiss authorities to comply with Safe Harbor Principles; or bound by a contract between Pontoon and the third party to handle personal information only in a way that complies with Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
<h5>
	Security of Personal Information</h5>
<p>
	Pontoon employs physical, technical and operational security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, disclosure, or alteration of personal information submitted to us. We are committed to keeping your personal information private and will continue to take steps to back up this commitment.</p>
<h5>
	Updating and Correcting Personal Information</h5>
<p>
	You may contact a Pontoon representative about reviewing or updating your personal information. If you would like to review, modify, or delete the personal information processed by Pontoon, you may contact us at the address below. We will make reasonable efforts to address your request.</p>
<h5>
	Cookies</h5>
<p>
	This website may use non-persistent cookies in conjunction with its hosted application services. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer&#39;s hard drive. A cookie does not read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites.

You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser.
